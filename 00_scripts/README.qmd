The SoIB codebase contains several functions relevant for the main analytical workflow but also many helper functions for both inside and outside this main pipeline. All these are outlined below.

All individual scripts are housed in `00_scripts/`. Numerical prefixes in filenames indicate where in the pipeline the scripts fall: 

- `00_*.R` Setup & helper functions
- `01_*.R` Main analysis 
- `02_*.R` Plotting 
- `10_*.R` Analyses from the Systematic Monitoring chapter of the report 
- `20_*.R` Website-specific steps and outputs 
- `30_*.R` Mass communication like acknowledgement certificates 

Scripts without prefixes may fall in multiple steps of the pipeline, from the main analyses steps to auxiliary outputs. The primary scripts for the main analysis are the ones referred to in order in `00_pipeline.R`.

## Helper functions

Helper functions are stored in the script `00_soisauce.R`.

### `analyses_metadata`

```{r}
source(here::here("00_scripts/00_soisauce.R"))

n_col <- dim(pathfinder())[2]
n_mask <- dim(pathfinder() %>% select(contains("MASK")))[2]
```

This sets up the folder structure for the analytical workflow that spans multiple spatial scales (national, states, habitats) and analysis steps (and therefore folders and files). The main use of this feature is seamless operation of file paths. Therefore, the script `01_create_metadata.R` need only be run *when there is any change* to any folder/path structure. It also ensures the folder structures are matched, by creating the necessary folders that do not already exist (though it will not delete old folders). This script saves the metadata as `analyses_metadata.RData`.

All other times, the helper function `pathfinder()` can be used to obtain either the entire metadata base `pathfinder()` or the metadata for the spatial unit/mask of interest `pathfinder(mask)`. The metadata contains `{r} n_col - n_mask` columns of paths, which each correspond to a specific folder or file path, and `{r} n_mask` columns relating to the mask itself. It is best to simply select the required path directly from the output using `$`, like `pathfinder("none")$SOIBMAIN.PATH`.

**Note that the idea here is to avoid manually coding file paths whenever possible!**

### `soib_year_info`

Get year-related info for different SoIB contexts. e.g., get list of labels for time periods used in figures; get list of years considered for Current Annual Trends; get list of years for IUCN projection. Updated each time `readcleanrawdata()` run, i.e., `soib_year_info` is based on underlying eBird data!

Usage: `soib_year_info("latest_year")`

### `get_iucn_proj_cols`

Programmatically obtain list of column names for all IUCN projection years.

### `specname_to_india_checklist`

Convert eBird names to India Checklist names. Uses manually curated mapping sheet (`SoIB_mapping_2023.csv`).

### `get_latest_IUCN_status`

Add or update column with IUCN status of bird species. Uses manually curated mapping sheet (`SoIB_mapping_2023.csv`).

### `get_soib_status_cats`

SoIB status categories have changed since the first iteration in 2020. This function helps easily get the various status categories functionally, preventing the need to copy paste several strings every time.

Usage: `get_soib_status_cats("trend")`

### `ebird_tax_mapping`

eBird species names change every year, which proves difficult when working on annual updates. This function helps map these different names, using a single mapping file---and avoids having to read in the specific file every time (also minimising chances of error).

## Setup functions

`00_functions.R` and `00_plot_functions.R` contain setup functions for the main analyses and plotting steps respectively. `00_functions.R` contains several fundamental functions that would make more sense being moved out into `01_*.R` scripts.

## Plotting functions

Plotting functions are structured at multiple levels. 

1. At the finest grain, individual trend plots and range maps can be generated using `soib_trend_plot()`, `soib_trend_plot_sysmon()` and `soib_rangemap()` in `00_plot_functions.R`. This will most likely be done just for testing. Since the input data for all of these figures depends on several factors such as spatial unit (mask, for range maps) and trend type (long-term vs current annual, for trend plots), this kind of setup needs to happen before the figures can be generated. 
2. Enter `gen_trend_plots()`, `gen_trend_plots_sysmon()` and `gen_range_maps()` in `02_generate_plots.R`. These functions are to be thought of as the go-to to generate any figure, whereas those in #1 can be considered as just setting up the plot settings, theme, etc. For instance, `gen_trend_plots()` lets you specify trend type (long-term vs current annual), species (one or more specific species, vs all qualifying species), and even "plot type" which refers to single-species plots, single-species comparison plots (comparing mask with national), multispecies plots, and composite plots. 
3. At the highest level, `02_plot_pipeline.R` does for figure plotting what `00_pipeline.R` does for the main analysis, where one has to only run the different sections in order after the results have been generated.

The other four `02_generate_*.R` scripts generate figures specific to the SoIB 2023 report, like the eBird list point map and the other species of interest plot.

## Main analysis scripts

These major scripts are typically run in the following order (refer `00_pipeline.R`):

- Data analysis
  - *some functions directly from `00_functions.R`*
    - `rm_prob_mistakes.R` (from within `readcleanrawdata()`)
  - `filter_data_for_species.R`
  - `create_random_groupids.R`
  - `create_random_datafiles.R`
  - `run_species_trends.R`
  - Occupancy analysis
    - `run_species_occupancy-setup.R`
    - `run_species_occupancy-presence.R`
    - `run_species_occupancy-model.R`
  - `resolve_trends_and_occupancy.R`
  - `classify_and_summarise.R`
- Post-analysis steps
  - `redlist.R`
  - `key_species_states.R`
  - `plot_statewise_pas.R`
  - `plot_statewise_prioritygrids.R`
  - `state_summary_posters.R`
  
## One-time runs

These are run just once, typically before the analysis steps.

- `create_india_DEM.R`: Create DEM object of India from TIF file.
- `create_habitat_masks_dataframe.R`: Create sf objects of habitat masks from geojson file.
- `validation_model_specifications.R`: Testing statistical validity of model specified with interaction of two variables without individual effects of each variable.
